# Cat clicker with separation of concern
A javascript app where you choose different cats and click on the photo to increment number of clicks developed to manually simulate MVC design pattern (model is implemented in "model" object, view is implemented in "viewCat", "viewButton" and "viewAdmin" objects, controller is implemented in "octopus" object).  
The app includes an Admin mode where you can manually make changes to the selected cat (change name, photo url or number of clicks)
